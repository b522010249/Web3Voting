**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

My team isn't collaborating on assignments. One person said that he was busy working on another project and preparing to do an internship. The other person, when working, always likes to come to work on days when the work is almost due, making the work impossible to follow up and fix in time.

### Analyzing the Bundle Size

There was one day that I didn't like very much. There was a test presentation. On that day, the teacher gave me 1 hour to prepare. That day, in the group, there was just me and one other person. The entire 1 hour time that I assigned to the other person was not. Doing anything mostly drags the mouse around more than the other person is late. I had already told him that could come because It was going to give a presentation but not us group but then hadn't arrived yet, but he  chose to sit outside and wait until class time was over. So I decided to do nothing and didn't want to get any points of it.
